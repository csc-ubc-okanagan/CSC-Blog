<p>Since Python is so widely used, there are many people who contribute to continuously improving and developing it. Let’s imagine Python as a base version. It can do basic calculations, but it requires extra efforts to do more complicated things. People have created extras or add-ons to help create shortcuts for more complicated specific tasks or functions. These ‘add-ons’ are called modules. A module allows us to use already defined classes, functions, variables, and more. Packages are a collection of similar modules. These modules are stored together in a package to help with storage and ease of use.</p>
<p>Packages can be imported to use to help make things easier. For example, there is a Python package called math that helps with basic mathematical operations.</p>
<p>To use a package or specific module within it, we use the <code>import</code> command. The format of these commands is as followed:</p>
<p><code>import package.subpackage.modulename</code></p>
<p>We can also nickname the packages to make it easier when we use them. This is done using the <code>as</code> statement. An example of this is <code>import pandas as pd</code>. By doing this, whenever a function from pandas is used, instead of having to type <code>pandas.function_name</code>, we can type <code>pd.function_name</code>. This may not seem like a big difference, but when it is used repeatedly, this can save a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>A few of the main packages used in python include:</p>
