<p>Color schemes are a matter of preference, but I think many of us can agree that RStudioâ€™s default theme is quite bright and low-contrast. Fortunately, RStudio offers some alternative themes, which you can see by clicking on <code>Tools &gt; Global Options</code> in the top ribbon menu in RStudio. You can then select <code>Appearance</code> and change the Editor theme.</p>
<p>Of the default themes, the Cobalt theme is my preferred one, but I find some of the colors to be too similar (such as the white for general text and the light blue used for headings in <code>R</code> Markdown documents). You can find the custom theme I use <a href="https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/misc/blob/main/Black%20Rmd.rstheme">on my GitHub page</a>. To add use this theme, go to <code>Tools &gt; Global Options</code>, then select <code>Appearance</code>, and click on <code>Add</code>. Finally, select the <code>Black Rmd.rstheme</code> file, and click on <code>Open</code>.</p>
