<h2>Python can be used as a calculator</h2>
<pre class="python"><code>1 + 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 2</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>2-3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## -1</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>6 / 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 3.0</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>3 * 4</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 12</code></pre>
<p>Since Python is so widely used, there are many people who contribute to continuously improving and developing it. Let’s imagine Python as a base version. It can do basic calculations, but it requires extra efforts to do more complicated things. People have created extras or add-ons to help create shortcuts for more complicated specific tasks or functions. These ‘add-ons’ are called packages. Packages can be imported to use to help make things easier. For example, there is a Python package called math that helps with basic mathematical operations. Let’s look at an example here of calling the package using the <code>import</code> command.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import math
math.sqrt(9)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 3.0</code></pre>
<p>Once it has been imported, it does not need to be re-imported for the rest of this document. You can also import multiple packages within the same document. We will get into more useful packages later on!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>math.log(100)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 4.605170185988092</code></pre>
<p>For now, practice typing basic calculations into your Python terminal to get used to the syntax, and see how easy it is to calculate things!</p>
